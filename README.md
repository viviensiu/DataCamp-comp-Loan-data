# Background:
This is a Data Camp workspace competition. We're given a LendingClub loan dataset and we need to come up with our own goals for the data set. Checkout my notebook

# Objective:
Assuming that we are investors new to The LendingClub, and our goal is to maximize profit while minimize potential losses as much as we can.

# Methodology:
1) Examine the data set for missing values and checking on statistical insight.
2) Perform EDA to identify correlations and patterns between features using various data visualization techniques.
3) Summarize the analysis and insights from EDA.
4) Leveraging on the analysis results, propose recommendations that meet our goal and filter data set.
5) Perform data visualization with said recommendations on filtered data set.
6) Quantify the outcome and compare with original data set to conclude.

# Conclusion:
Taking a moderate, calculated risks' approach did not reduce our returns and we still have some attractive potential high returns choices to go for.

# Ideas for expansion:
- this data set could benefit with data enrichment as it's missing some important variables, like loan grade, loan amount, and loan terms, which will really help us in performing further feature engineering for gauging on the actual returns.
- Regression model: Interest rates prediction.
- Classification model: Whether or not loans will be paid back in full.
